# SpedenSpelit-SpeedTest

This project was made in 2023 on our 1st year of study during the 2nd period in Oulu University Of Applied Sciences
This Arduino project was inspired by the infamous SpedenSpelit - Nopeuspeli (speed test) game.
The idea of this game is to keep pressing buttons in same order as their corresponding LEDs as the game keeps getting faster and faster in interval of 10 LEDs been lit.
The game will end if the user pressess wrong button.
